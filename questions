#There are some questions  I want to clarify….
##unsolved
1. After image interpolation, Gaussian blur is necessary or not?
取消卷积，直接乘
no identical difference 
try without jacobian now 

4. Check Jacobian again     own task
从头到尾

##finished
5. Read more paper        own task
为什么不用geo方法  

5.1.intensity-based z.B:ICP(and many improved versions),PASHA

5.2.geo-based(feature-based) 需要extract points 坐标的距离 (surface, feature) 
need initialization: prior knowledge, marker, mannual initialization(GUI)
after registration, validation is necessary.

5.3.gradient-based 

5.4. hybrid algorithm, geo+intensity (how to extract feature points)
(projection, back-projection, reconstruction......)
For difficult, majority of published registration methods employed a rigid transformation(3 rotations, 3 translations)

6. Get to know the original T AND compare it
找ground truth

##solved
7.  是否是算法的原因 还是 图像的形状 对比ssd 参数原因还是算法原因
uniform registration
from results, we can see the uniform deformation is caused by algorithm. 

    
2. Initial affect results a lot. It is very easy to be stuck in local optimum.    Result
3. How to assess the outcome of 3d registration 
对比2维切片，求均值， 综合比较
